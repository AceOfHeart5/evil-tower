	Why do we need to check for image_change in a run script that sets image_speed to 0?
	I'm not 100% sure... but this is what I think is happening. In the ladder_up and down states
	the image speed is 1. Let's say on frame 1000, the actor was inputting up in the ladder
	up state, and the image_index was something like 0.9999999999. But then on frame
	1001 the actor has no inputs. The connect scripts run and determines the actor
	should be in ladder_idle. But note that image speed was still 1 in between frames.
	I believe this is where game maker increments image_index. So, the image index 
	has probably increased to 1 at this point. And our image_change script will catch that.
	But if our run script does respond to it, then we have a situation where the actor was 
	climbing the ladder, the image_index changed, and there was no script to play a sound
	for that. Therefore, we have to check for it here, in Idle.
